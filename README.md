# ShaguJunk

This addon can automatically delete and vendor specified items. It comes with two lists.
A vendor-list that automatically sells all items on it to a merchant and a delete-list that
automatically deletes the specified items whenever a new item is pushed into the inventory.

The lists can by displayed by typing `/junk ls`. You can add new entries to the list by either
typing `/junk delete ITEMNAME` for the delete list or `/junk vendor ITEMNAME` for the vendor list.
Instead of typing the item name, one can also use item links (shift-click the item).

Removing items from the list can be done via `/junk rm ID`, where ID is the identifier number
that is shown in `/junk ls`.

If the `/junk` command is already occupied by another addon, the `/sjunk` command can be used.
